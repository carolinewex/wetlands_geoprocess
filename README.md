# wetlands_geoprocess
A python script that sums the total acreage and total linear feet recorded from a wetlands survey across TFTA, then summarizes the total calculations according to the attribute Cowardin Aggregate (a wetland classification system). The output is two master tables containing the totals joined to a map series in ArcGIS Pro.
